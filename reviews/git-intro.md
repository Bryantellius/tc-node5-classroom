## Git

> Git is a _distributed version control system_, "virtual workspace", staging platform for directories/repositories
> A _version control system_ manages states, current and previous, of files allowing the author(s) to revert the state of any file, or the entire project itself to a previous working/different state.
> A _distributed_ version control system distributes clones/copies of the entire project AND the entire git history to any collaborator to have locally.

## Git Commands

`git init` - initializes directory/project as git repo; git starts looking a project

`git config` - used to updated configuration options with local git cli, use `--global` to set global config variables

## Git Workflow

`git add .` - adds a file(s) to the staging area

`git commit -m "message"` - appends a message with a commit, or _snapshot_ of the current state of the project/file

`git push [-u origin main]` - pushs your local changes to be merged with the remote repo

`git pull` - pulls the remote changes to be merged with your local repo

`git diff` - displays a patch set of changes from previous committed version and current, unstaged changes

`git status` - displays the status of files, untracked/tracked, staged/unstaged

`git branch` - lists git branches

`git restore <FILE>` - unstages a modified file, keeps edits

`git checkout <FILE>` - unstages and removes edits, restores a file to its previously committed version

`git reset HEAD` - undo changes and specify a commit to restore

`git revert HEAD/134dssd4` - undo commits
